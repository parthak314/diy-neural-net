# diy-neural-net
This project will take you through understanding a neural network, the maths behind it and how it is used for basic projects. This will also help you to break from 'tutorial hell', if that's you.

Please note that this guide is there to help anyone from a basic level. To view a high level overview please see the [README](README.md)

There is a lot of hype around ai, but what is it actually? Most tutorials will start from using python libraries such as keras, pytorch or tensorflow. But there is more to this.

## Project Goal
To actually understand how this works, let's work on a simple project to recognise a single digit number using basic python (including numpy and pandas - which are only there to save time, our understanding won't be affected by this).

Note that much of this is inspired by the neural network series by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

## Prereqs
Let's think about how this idea will work.

We need to have some sort of input and output system here. Let's begin by taking in some data.

A quick Google search will help us to find the MNIST dataset which is many numbers put together.

Note that our end goal is to build a system where we can write a number, and the text version is produced.


## Challenge: characters
Using the EMNIST dataset

## Extending this project
Now it's up to you!

Keep me posted on what you decide to go on to do from here, but to help you here are a few ideas:
- Recogniser game - draw an object and the system recognises it
- Create a One-note addon (or any other tool) to change the handwriting to text live
- Multilingual recogniser - such as Arabic or Devanagari characters
- An app to take a picture and retrieve key information such as total amount spent from receipts.
